To collobrate with other people
You could be in the middle of coding a feature, and do not want to bother with merging, or you could be doing something completely different and do not want to deal with remote branch anymore
forks = clone + commit on repo on github, also allows tracking of the original forked repo
branch is just commit to a different branch 
clone is just copying a repo
allows you to merge with remote without having internet connection
