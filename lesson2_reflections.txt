.git is created which is needed to store the meta data for this repo
working directory is everything, staging area is files that can be committed
staging area allows people to bundle files into 1 commit
add changes to staging area for the same logical change, commit when changes are done for this logical change
branches can be used to allow for experimentation or development of features or functions that are seperate of the main branch
you can see where branches happened and what has occured since then
you get one branch, where commits are interleaved by timestamps
it makes it easier to visualize the changes since
saves time but author will not know of logical errors
